We will be discussing this\r\nat the xAPI Bootcamp in July as the effort came out of the work weâ€™ve done\r\nin building and testing scalability and security matters throughout the\r\nbuild of our learning record store and visualization layer.\r\n\r\nThis document should be considered a general draft outline.","google":"UA-70801960-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
